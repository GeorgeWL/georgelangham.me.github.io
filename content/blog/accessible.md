The Barnsley Assistive Technology Team is a nationally recognised specialised service that works with other professionals in local teams to provide electronic assistive technology.
Vicky and her team went into such a great level of depth without getting overly bogged down in the details.

I can wholeheartedly recommend that you book them in if you can.

Hereâ€™s their blog: https://barnsleyat.wordpress.com/
