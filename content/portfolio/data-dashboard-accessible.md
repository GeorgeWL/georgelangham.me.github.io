In my Final Year of University, as my course is technical instead of a dissertation, the Final Year project is to develop a prototype web application using web technologies, with an accompanying report.

I decided to create a Data Dashboard with additional features added to make it more accesible for Visually impaired users (*defined as having 10/20 acuity or less*)

To this end a Web App was created using the Libraries of [D3.js](https://d3js.org) and the Web Audio API to make graphs and charts which, thanks to the libraries of D3 and through some custom javascript, were able to be readable by Screen-readers, and would scale dynamically to any size of browser zoom without loss in quality.

Site will be posted here when the examiners have finished marking, due to university regulations it cannot be posted now.
