This poster was created for a design competition hosted by [Greater Manchester Rock Climbing](https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Manchester-Rock-Climbing/) Meetup group.

The purpose of the poster is to try and increase the number of members in the group.

The prize was a Years' subscription to membership, which I'm happy to say that I won (and have been using to the full extent.)

I was decided as the winner, and then after a few revisions of the poster, it reached this final state, and is now being used by the group.
