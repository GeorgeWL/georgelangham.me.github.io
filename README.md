Creative portfolio is a clean and elegant template mainly made for designers and creatives but can be easily transformed into a generic website.

# georgelangham.me.github.io

This site is a Static Generated Site, made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and Automatically Deployed from a git repository using [Forestry.io](//Forestry.io)

The power of Hugo is that through the use of layout files, every div can easily be created or edited through HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then Injected into place by the program.

The simplest way to think of it is that every page is a template with empty spaces (assigned by the user or the theme) for Formatted Text to go into. And Hugo is the Glue which sticks that Text in place.

Iâ€™m currently using a heavily modified version of the the [Hugo Creative Portfolio Theme](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme) by Github User [@Kishaningithub.](https://github.com/kishaningithub)

# The Current Deployment method is as such:

## For Content Changes

Login to the Forestry.io Headless CMS ([headlessCMS.org](//headlesscms.org) for a definition of what defines a Headless CMS)

Edit or Create Markdown Files using existing Templates, 

Forestry automatically pushes these to the Content folder, runs Hugo, which converts markdown in /Content/ to html and places them in the [/static](https://github.com/GeorgeWL/georgelangham.me.github.io/tree/dev/static) folder of the dev branch.

Forestry Publishes the contents of the /static/ folder in the dev branch of the Git onto the master branch as HTML/CSS/JavaScript files.

All contents of the master branch are automatically served as Webpages by Github Pages, due to a setting turned on in the options of the repository.

## Template and Layout Changes

deployed via opening the [/Layouts/](https://github.com/GeorgeWL/georgelangham.me.github.io/tree/dev/layouts) folder inside of the dev branch of the repository.

editing the [/partials/](https://github.com/GeorgeWL/georgelangham.me.github.io/tree/dev/layouts/partials), [/widgets](https://github.com/GeorgeWL/georgelangham.me.github.io/tree/dev/layouts/partials/widgets), /shortcodes or any of the other named templates.   Or potentially creating a new template file.

opening command prompt inside of the / folder

running the command hugo --theme [Theme-Name] once

syncing the changes back to the dev branch.

Forestry automatically publishes the new contents of the /static folder onto the Master branch

e.g.

about/single.html for editing the single page template of about.

e.g.

partials/sidebar.html for editing just the sidebar.

e.g.

portfolio/list for editing the grouped page template of Portfolio.
